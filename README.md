# A Divinator

Originally conceived as an adaptation of an L-System to generate Cantor sets, the realization quickly set in that my interest centered more on the ways in which the Cantor principle could be used to generate fake, broken _I Ching_-like hexagrams. As such, the purpose of this repository is to focus my bizarre implementation of a mathematical concept I certainly misunderstand in the service of writing visual poetry (vispo) or asemic pieces "divining" what may come of a type of bastardized L-System/Cantor set hybrid.

It's an experiment in being so wrong that it looks like I'm on to something.
